Life
Foundation Control, this is LF1.

2
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.529
The specimens are secured,
and we're heading home.

3
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:34.864
Roger, LF1.
You are a go for reentry.

4
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.766
Copy that.
Initiating reentry sequence.

5
00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:39.836
Point-four by 103-point...

6
00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:41.638
Oh, shit.

7
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.305
Seal it off.
Seal it off!

8
00:01:43.307 --> 00:01:44.706
LF1, Mission Control.

9
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.341
You're breaking up.
Please repeat.

10
00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:48.279
Mayday, Mayday, LF1!

11
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:49.846
- Mayday!
- LF1, Mission Control.

12
00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:51.680
Please repeat.

13
00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:54.018
LF1, Mission Control.
Please repeat.

14
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.634
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

15
00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:47.337
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

16
00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.338
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

17
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.906
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

18
00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:52.708
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

19
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.077
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

20
00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.713
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

21
00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.716
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

22
00:03:00.718 --> 00:03:02.918
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

23
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.720
No. We have
three of them.

24
00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:06.687
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

25
00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.760
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

26
00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:24.806
What is she saying?

27
00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:26.944
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

28
00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:33.949
That's Jameson.

29
00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:59.233
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

30
00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.670
I'm awake.

31
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:03.104
Missed me.

32
00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:04.805
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

33
00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:07.040
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

34
00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:10.077
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

35
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:12.579
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:14.881
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

37
00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:17.151
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

38
00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:18.786
My meeting?

39
00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:20.653
Oh, shit. Yeah.

40
00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:22.557
My meeting.

41
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:29.063
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

42
00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:30.964
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.867
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

44
00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:34.701
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

45
00:05:34.703 --> 00:05:37.637
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

46
00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.074
And please do not forget
your helmet.

47
00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:41.641
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

48
00:05:41.643 --> 00:05:43.144
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

49
00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:44.878
That's hot.

50
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.780
Feed the cat.

51
00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:48.082
I will.

52
00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:49.616
I love you!

53
00:05:49.618 --> 00:05:51.218
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

54
00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:12.073
Eddie Brock
with boots on the ground

55
00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:14.641
today in the Mission District,
chasing a lead into some...

56
00:06:14.643 --> 00:06:16.276
Everybody knows how
our Silicon Valley overlords

57
00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:18.545
at Google and Facebook...
Last time, I was poking around

58
00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:20.047
asking uncomfortable
questions...

59
00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:23.183
Homelessness is only increasing
into the thousands...

60
00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:26.186
Eddie Brock here reporting
today from downtown Oakland,

61
00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:29.290
where massive demonstrations
have taken over the streets.

62
00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:31.858
I've been chasing
this real-estate bribery story

63
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.960
for a few weeks now.

64
00:06:33.962 --> 00:06:35.962
This is gonna piss you off.
...all being strong-armed...

65
00:06:35.964 --> 00:06:38.164
Medical examiner has yet
to determine cause of death,

66
00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:40.033
due to the condition
of the body,

67
00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:42.601
but you don't wind up
at the bottom of a landfill

68
00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:45.738
due to natural causes,
so it seems that the city

69
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.242
doesn't care about these people
any more than the killer does.

70
00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:52.145
I'm Eddie Brock,
and this is The Brock Report.

71
00:06:52.147 --> 00:06:53.947
Hey, Richard!

72
00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.615
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

73
00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:58.717
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

74
00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:59.986
How'd she do?

75
00:06:59.988 --> 00:07:02.922
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

76
00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:04.923
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

77
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.625
You told me what?

78
00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:08.363
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

79
00:07:09.598 --> 00:07:10.930
The bike.

80
00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:14.334
MIT! Whoo!

81
00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:17.804
You know what I love
about this view?

82
00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:20.639
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

83
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:23.308
Height's not really my thing.

84
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.879
But, uh...
What's the deal?

85
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:28.248
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

86
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.882
Carlton Drake.

87
00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:31.918
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

88
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.120
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

89
00:07:34.122 --> 00:07:36.822
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

90
00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:38.190
Uh...

91
00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:40.193
He's... He's seriously off.

92
00:07:40.195 --> 00:07:41.894
I'm gonna level with you.

93
00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:44.297
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

94
00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:47.733
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

95
00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:50.736
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

96
00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:53.140
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

97
00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:58.076
He's a crook.

98
00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:01.280
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

99
00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:03.682
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

100
00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:06.386
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

101
00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:08.153
but no one
is above the network.

102
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:11.223
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

103
00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:12.925
All right, all right.

104
00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:17.296
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

105
00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:18.963
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

106
00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.766
It's not...
It's not what I do.

107
00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.301
Well, my mother
always told me

108
00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:25.270
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

109
00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:26.704
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

110
00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.907
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

111
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.342
- Oh.
- That's you...

112
00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.010
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

113
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.212
- Nah.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:34.413
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

115
00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:36.416
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

116
00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:38.884
That's what my mom told me.

117
00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.918
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

118
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.156
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

119
00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:46.225
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

120
00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:48.093
The guy you work for
is a complete...

121
00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:50.161
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

122
00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:51.797
and my firm works for him.

123
00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.266
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

124
00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:57.369
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

125
00:08:57.371 --> 00:09:00.138
- A repeat?
- Of the Daily Globe incident.

126
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.873
Ow! Really?

127
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.709
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

128
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:04.976
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

129
00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:06.378
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

130
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.914
No, I still have
currency in New York.

131
00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:11.216
I was going places.

132
00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:12.317
I wasn't running.

133
00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:14.085
I was going places.

134
00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:15.921
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

135
00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:18.789
- Me?
- You are my home.

136
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.528
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

137
00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.199
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

138
00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:28.467
Let's just get the check.

139
00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.197
I'm gonna get a drink.

140
00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:43.876
Shh.

141
00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:02.460
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

142
00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:05.028
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

143
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.299
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

144
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:11.000
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

145
00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:13.136
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

146
00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:15.406
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

147
00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.608
to go out there
and create things that others

148
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.009
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

149
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:23.079
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

150
00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:25.014
Come here. What's your name?

151
00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:27.050
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

152
00:11:27.052 --> 00:11:28.853
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

153
00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.322
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

154
00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:33.391
But you know what?
In the end,

155
00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:36.326
we're the ones
who change the world.

156
00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:39.262
Take good care
of that, Allie.

157
00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:41.030
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

158
00:11:41.032 --> 00:11:42.399
- Say hi.
- Hi.

159
00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:43.601
Hello, kids.

160
00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:45.635
Um, sorry to interrupt,

161
00:11:45.637 --> 00:11:48.004
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

162
00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:50.206
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

163
00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:52.509
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

164
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.979
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

165
00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:57.882
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

166
00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.916
What do you say,
Mr. Drake,

167
00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:01.651
we just start
at the beginning?

168
00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.920
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

169
00:12:03.922 --> 00:12:07.223
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

170
00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:10.025
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

171
00:12:10.027 --> 00:12:11.529
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

172
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:13.596
it tripled their
life expectancy.

173
00:12:13.598 --> 00:12:15.265
But it's okay.

174
00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:18.301
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

175
00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:20.303
All right, you create

176
00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:22.005
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

177
00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.673
- And then...
- Rockets.

178
00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:25.909
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

179
00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:27.912
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

180
00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.213
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

181
00:12:30.215 --> 00:12:32.047
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

182
00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:33.650
is crucial
in our quest to cure

183
00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:35.586
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

184
00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.153
But if you think about
everything we've found...

185
00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:38.588
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

186
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.523
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:43.025
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

188
00:12:43.027 --> 00:12:44.527
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

189
00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:46.362
from your pharmaceutical
companies

190
00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:48.163
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

191
00:12:48.165 --> 00:12:49.364
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

192
00:12:49.366 --> 00:12:50.700
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

193
00:12:50.702 --> 00:12:53.002
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

194
00:12:53.004 --> 00:12:54.604
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

195
00:12:54.606 --> 00:12:56.606
How does it...
How does it, um...

196
00:12:56.608 --> 00:12:58.540
I don't know,
how does it go about,

197
00:12:58.542 --> 00:13:01.611
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

198
00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:03.446
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

199
00:13:03.448 --> 00:13:05.447
I'm talking
about the allegations.

200
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:07.049
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

201
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.551
your entire empire
has been built

202
00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:10.620
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

203
00:13:10.622 --> 00:13:13.055
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

204
00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:15.258
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

205
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.593
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

206
00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:18.160
end up killing people.

207
00:13:18.162 --> 00:13:19.662
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

208
00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:21.029
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

209
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:22.464
Right. What about
the legal cases?

210
00:13:22.466 --> 00:13:24.032
Sorry?

211
00:13:24.034 --> 00:13:26.168
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

212
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.103
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

213
00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:29.438
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

214
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.038
And they're just some
of the people who walked

215
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.041
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

216
00:13:33.043 --> 00:13:34.711
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

217
00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:36.411
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

218
00:13:36.413 --> 00:13:37.679
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

219
00:13:37.681 --> 00:13:39.482
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

220
00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:40.350
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

221
00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:41.216
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

222
00:13:41.218 --> 00:13:42.084
Is that a threat?

223
00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:43.721
Have a nice life.

224
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.391
I know what
you're going to say, but...

225
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:52.060
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

226
00:13:52.062 --> 00:13:54.095
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

227
00:13:54.097 --> 00:13:56.635
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

228
00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:04.072
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

229
00:14:04.074 --> 00:14:06.041
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

230
00:14:06.043 --> 00:14:08.777
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

231
00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:10.344
We do the work.

232
00:14:10.346 --> 00:14:13.048
We substantiate
our accusations.

233
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.117
We provide evidence.

234
00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:18.453
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

235
00:14:24.728 --> 00:14:26.394
You're fired, Eddie.

236
00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:28.397
I can't trust you.

237
00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:31.033
Have a nice life.

238
00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:32.803
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

239
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.671
Hey.

240
00:14:35.673 --> 00:14:37.673
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

241
00:14:37.675 --> 00:14:39.206
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

242
00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.241
Your ego requires
constant attention,

243
00:14:40.243 --> 00:14:42.310
and you're stubborn as hell.

244
00:14:42.312 --> 00:14:44.546
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

245
00:14:44.548 --> 00:14:46.717
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

246
00:14:48.686 --> 00:14:50.753
What you did
got me fired.

247
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:53.591
You used me.

248
00:15:00.464 --> 00:15:03.634
Annie? Annie.

249
00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:38.267
Oh, my God.

250
00:15:41.604 --> 00:15:43.406
You're beautiful.

251
00:17:40.757 --> 00:17:42.455
Test 36.

252
00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:43.990
Biological interactions

253
00:17:43.992 --> 00:17:46.325
between two different organisms.

254
00:17:46.327 --> 00:17:48.929
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

255
00:17:48.931 --> 00:17:50.964
in order to survive
for any amount of time

256
00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:52.799
in an oxygen-rich environment.

257
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:54.234
Well, why are
all these hosts

258
00:17:54.236 --> 00:17:55.770
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

259
00:17:55.772 --> 00:17:57.739
That's what
we're trying to find out.

260
00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:01.977
The bonding process
is starting.

261
00:18:07.382 --> 00:18:08.483
It's equalizing.

262
00:18:14.656 --> 00:18:17.556
But why? Why this rabbit?

263
00:18:17.558 --> 00:18:20.261
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

264
00:18:20.263 --> 00:18:22.996
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

265
00:18:22.998 --> 00:18:25.564
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

266
00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:29.435
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

267
00:18:29.437 --> 00:18:33.739
but also we would
be able to survive there.

268
00:18:33.741 --> 00:18:35.441
"We"?

269
00:18:35.443 --> 00:18:37.577
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

270
00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:39.545
to even begin to think
about something like...

271
00:18:39.547 --> 00:18:40.980
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

272
00:18:40.982 --> 00:18:43.483
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

273
00:18:43.485 --> 00:18:45.285
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

274
00:18:45.287 --> 00:18:47.020
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

275
00:18:47.022 --> 00:18:48.889
Hey, how are your kids?

276
00:18:50.926 --> 00:18:52.425
Let's begin human trials.

277
00:18:52.427 --> 00:18:53.562
Good work.

278
00:19:15.884 --> 00:19:17.018
Hey, Jack.

279
00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:20.986
Do you ever feel
like your life

280
00:19:20.988 --> 00:19:24.623
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

281
00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.358
Here at the Life Foundation,

282
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.393
- we've always believed...
- Isn't that your buddy?

283
00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:29.862
...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.

284
00:19:29.864 --> 00:19:31.563
In the months
since our rocket failed,

285
00:19:31.565 --> 00:19:33.099
we've learned so much.

286
00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:36.336
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

287
00:19:36.338 --> 00:19:37.803
Some people
are trying to watch that.

288
00:19:37.805 --> 00:19:39.339
Oh, you are, are you?

289
00:19:39.341 --> 00:19:41.709
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

290
00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:45.344
I used to be.

291
00:19:45.346 --> 00:19:47.013
We take
the same view of progress.

292
00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:49.648
Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation

293
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.618
has now begun preparations
on its next launch.

294
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.019
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

295
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:55.989
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

296
00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:58.023
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

297
00:19:58.025 --> 00:20:00.025
playing hard to get.

298
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:05.497
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

299
00:20:05.499 --> 00:20:08.133
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

300
00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:10.137
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

301
00:20:12.873 --> 00:20:14.506
Cost you $5.

302
00:20:14.508 --> 00:20:16.641
$5 for a paper that's free?

303
00:20:16.643 --> 00:20:18.643
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

304
00:20:18.645 --> 00:20:21.446
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

305
00:20:21.448 --> 00:20:23.916
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

306
00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:24.983
You did that for me?

307
00:20:24.985 --> 00:20:26.586
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

308
00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:30.656
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

309
00:20:30.658 --> 00:20:33.091
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

310
00:20:33.093 --> 00:20:34.759
I'll throw in the paper.

311
00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:37.495
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

312
00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:38.966
but not to sing,
all right?

313
00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:40.731
Deal.

314
00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:42.633
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

315
00:20:42.635 --> 00:20:46.470
No. You're welcome.

316
00:20:46.472 --> 00:20:48.773
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

317
00:20:48.775 --> 00:20:51.043
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

318
00:20:51.045 --> 00:20:53.045
you know, aches and pains.

319
00:20:53.047 --> 00:20:54.214
You look like shit.

320
00:20:55.115 --> 00:20:56.614
Excuse me?

321
00:20:56.616 --> 00:20:57.984
You look like shit.

322
00:20:59.553 --> 00:21:02.187
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

323
00:21:02.189 --> 00:21:04.922
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

324
00:21:04.924 --> 00:21:06.792
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

325
00:21:06.794 --> 00:21:08.794
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

326
00:21:08.796 --> 00:21:10.928
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

327
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.131
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

328
00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:16.935
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

329
00:21:16.937 --> 00:21:18.669
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

330
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:19.837
That is the problem.

331
00:21:24.811 --> 00:21:27.712
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

332
00:21:27.714 --> 00:21:30.114
Please.

333
00:21:30.116 --> 00:21:31.582
Let's go.

334
00:21:31.584 --> 00:21:33.085
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

335
00:21:35.888 --> 00:21:39.124
The full payment is due.
Now.

336
00:21:39.126 --> 00:21:41.226
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

337
00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:42.929
I don't like to wait.

338
00:22:01.114 --> 00:22:02.215
Life hurts, Eddie.

339
00:22:02.949 --> 00:22:04.217
It just does.

340
00:22:21.566 --> 00:22:24.567
I gotta go.

341
00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:28.639
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

342
00:22:32.045 --> 00:22:33.277
What a dick.

343
00:23:02.808 --> 00:23:04.641
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

344
00:23:04.643 --> 00:23:06.176
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

345
00:23:06.178 --> 00:23:07.644
I can use a pseudonym.

346
00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:09.113
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

347
00:23:09.115 --> 00:23:11.114
I could be a woman.
Have you seen Tootsie?

348
00:23:16.955 --> 00:23:18.021
I'll call you back.

349
00:23:18.023 --> 00:23:19.891
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

350
00:23:25.897 --> 00:23:31.335
Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.

351
00:23:31.337 --> 00:23:35.171
Make the now the primary
focus of your life.

352
00:23:35.173 --> 00:23:37.639
Any action is often better
than no action,

353
00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:39.276
especially if you
have been stuck

354
00:23:39.278 --> 00:23:43.012
in an unhappy situation
for a long time.

355
00:23:43.014 --> 00:23:46.015
If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,

356
00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:47.650
in which case
it's no longer...

357
00:24:07.172 --> 00:24:09.905
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

358
00:24:09.907 --> 00:24:14.344
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

359
00:24:14.346 --> 00:24:16.013
History starts now.

360
00:24:16.947 --> 00:24:18.715
This is day one.

361
00:24:18.717 --> 00:24:21.985
This is first contact.

362
00:24:21.987 --> 00:24:24.354
Let's get to work.

363
00:24:37.202 --> 00:24:39.337
Establishing subject baseline.

364
00:24:41.372 --> 00:24:43.674
All vital signs are normal.

365
00:24:50.281 --> 00:24:52.415
Put me through.

366
00:24:52.417 --> 00:24:54.252
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

367
00:24:56.687 --> 00:24:58.053
There's no need.

368
00:24:58.055 --> 00:25:01.089
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

369
00:25:01.091 --> 00:25:03.125
Yes, sir.

370
00:25:03.127 --> 00:25:05.260
God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,

371
00:25:05.262 --> 00:25:07.996
"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing

372
00:25:07.998 --> 00:25:11.166
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

373
00:25:11.168 --> 00:25:13.235
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

374
00:25:13.237 --> 00:25:16.308
It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.

375
00:25:20.945 --> 00:25:23.845
Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,

376
00:25:23.847 --> 00:25:25.180
but it doesn't change
anything for me.

377
00:25:25.182 --> 00:25:29.984
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

378
00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:32.888
Look around you.
Look at the world.

379
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.356
What do you see?
War, poverty,

380
00:25:34.358 --> 00:25:36.724
a planet on the brink
of collapse.

381
00:25:36.726 --> 00:25:39.795
I would argue that God
has abandoned us.

382
00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:41.430
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

383
00:25:41.432 --> 00:25:44.466
so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.

384
00:25:44.468 --> 00:25:47.004
And this time, Isaac,
we can.

385
00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:53.007
We will.

386
00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:56.080
This time,
I will not abandon us.

387
00:25:58.415 --> 00:25:59.483
Yes.

388
00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:03.387
Open it.

389
00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:18.466
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

390
00:26:18.468 --> 00:26:20.202
Please let me... No.

391
00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:22.371
Oh, please, please, please!

392
00:26:39.822 --> 00:26:42.524
His vitals are holding steady.

393
00:26:42.526 --> 00:26:45.227
- Where the hell did it go?
- Incredible.

394
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:46.796
Where did it go?

395
00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:52.967
Where is it?

396
00:27:30.973 --> 00:27:32.275
Bring in the next volunteer.

397
00:28:01.336 --> 00:28:04.038
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

398
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.439
I was...

399
00:28:05.441 --> 00:28:08.174
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

400
00:28:08.176 --> 00:28:12.346
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

401
00:28:12.348 --> 00:28:17.884
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

402
00:28:17.886 --> 00:28:19.453
I mean...

403
00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:21.257
You have to know
how to disappear.

404
00:28:22.958 --> 00:28:26.326
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

405
00:28:26.328 --> 00:28:28.264
Whoever you are, you suck.

406
00:28:29.265 --> 00:28:31.231
Okay.

407
00:28:31.233 --> 00:28:33.299
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

408
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:34.635
I need your help.

409
00:28:34.637 --> 00:28:36.337
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

410
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:38.071
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

411
00:28:38.073 --> 00:28:40.073
We're done.

412
00:28:40.075 --> 00:28:41.674
No...

413
00:28:41.676 --> 00:28:45.011
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

414
00:28:45.013 --> 00:28:47.080
Everything that you
accused him of,

415
00:28:47.082 --> 00:28:48.415
you were right.
It's all true.

416
00:28:48.417 --> 00:28:49.948
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

417
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.018
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

418
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.354
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

419
00:28:54.356 --> 00:28:56.189
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

420
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:58.258
and they are dying.

421
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.360
They are all dying.

422
00:29:00.362 --> 00:29:01.930
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

423
00:29:02.899 --> 00:29:04.099
Come here.

424
00:29:06.133 --> 00:29:07.334
Why would I believe you?

425
00:29:07.336 --> 00:29:08.502
Because it's true.

426
00:29:08.504 --> 00:29:10.270
I believed in him, and I...

427
00:29:10.272 --> 00:29:12.205
I told myself
that it was worth it

428
00:29:12.207 --> 00:29:14.375
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

429
00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:15.942
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

430
00:29:15.944 --> 00:29:17.243
I can't do that.

431
00:29:17.245 --> 00:29:19.045
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

432
00:29:19.047 --> 00:29:20.680
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

433
00:29:20.682 --> 00:29:22.348
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

434
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.017
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

435
00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:26.219
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

436
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:28.588
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

437
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.357
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

438
00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:33.662
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

439
00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:37.196
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

440
00:29:37.198 --> 00:29:39.499
genuinely,
and you have proof,

441
00:29:39.501 --> 00:29:42.569
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

442
00:29:42.571 --> 00:29:44.604
I am.

443
00:29:44.606 --> 00:29:46.606
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

444
00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:48.074
because I am done.

445
00:29:48.076 --> 00:29:49.444
I am done
with all of this shit.

446
00:29:50.312 --> 00:29:51.678
What shit?

447
00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.647
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

448
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:56.218
All right? Good night.

449
00:30:15.402 --> 00:30:16.403
Eddie?

450
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:19.005
Well, hey. Whoa.

451
00:30:19.007 --> 00:30:22.040
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

452
00:30:22.042 --> 00:30:23.375
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

453
00:30:23.377 --> 00:30:25.143
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

454
00:30:25.145 --> 00:30:26.980
Eddie...

455
00:30:26.982 --> 00:30:28.581
This is Dan.

456
00:30:28.583 --> 00:30:30.617
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:30.619 --> 00:30:32.351
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

458
00:30:32.353 --> 00:30:34.019
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

459
00:30:34.021 --> 00:30:35.087
- Really?
- Yeah.

460
00:30:35.089 --> 00:30:37.089
I'm a big fan of your work.

461
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:39.424
- Thank you.
- Really?

462
00:30:39.426 --> 00:30:41.629
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

463
00:30:42.531 --> 00:30:44.064
Yeah, I was one of them.

464
00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:47.599
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

465
00:30:47.601 --> 00:30:49.236
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

466
00:30:51.205 --> 00:30:53.107
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

467
00:31:00.147 --> 00:31:02.316
He has a key. You know he has a key?

468
00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.684
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

469
00:31:07.589 --> 00:31:11.156
Yeah. Well, uh...

470
00:31:11.158 --> 00:31:13.559
So, uh, what you up to?

471
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:16.762
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

472
00:31:16.764 --> 00:31:18.799
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

473
00:31:20.034 --> 00:31:22.367
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

474
00:31:22.369 --> 00:31:24.336
No, he's a doctor.

475
00:31:24.338 --> 00:31:26.373
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

476
00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:29.373
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

477
00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:30.810
I would say
that he misses you,

478
00:31:30.812 --> 00:31:32.578
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

479
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.279
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

480
00:31:34.281 --> 00:31:35.681
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

481
00:31:35.683 --> 00:31:38.050
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

482
00:31:38.052 --> 00:31:39.251
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

483
00:31:39.253 --> 00:31:40.321
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

484
00:31:41.422 --> 00:31:43.321
A lot.

485
00:31:43.323 --> 00:31:44.723
You know, we were gonna
get married.

486
00:31:44.725 --> 00:31:47.292
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

487
00:31:47.294 --> 00:31:49.196
I can't really believe
that we're not...

488
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.600
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

489
00:31:54.568 --> 00:31:56.103
No, we can't.

490
00:31:58.639 --> 00:32:00.239
You did this, Eddie.

491
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:04.810
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

492
00:32:04.812 --> 00:32:05.879
You.

493
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.246
Uh, hello.
This is Dr. Skirth.

494
00:33:15.248 --> 00:33:16.649
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

495
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:19.485
Talk to me.

496
00:33:23.423 --> 00:33:25.589
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

497
00:33:25.591 --> 00:33:26.926
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

498
00:33:29.194 --> 00:33:31.798
53.5,
win-909 RPM.

499
00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:38.869
Whew.

500
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:41.439
Overpopulation
and climate change.

501
00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:43.574
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

502
00:33:43.576 --> 00:33:45.542
Yeah, got it, right.

503
00:33:45.544 --> 00:33:48.579
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable Earth.

504
00:33:48.581 --> 00:33:51.414
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

505
00:33:51.416 --> 00:33:53.516
to scout real estate.

506
00:33:53.518 --> 00:33:55.386
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

507
00:33:55.388 --> 00:33:57.521
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

508
00:33:57.523 --> 00:34:00.590
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

509
00:34:00.592 --> 00:34:03.427
On the way back,
they found a comet.

510
00:34:03.429 --> 00:34:05.730
A comet?

511
00:34:05.732 --> 00:34:08.798
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

512
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.735
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

513
00:34:10.737 --> 00:34:12.536
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

514
00:34:12.538 --> 00:34:14.205
You're talking about aliens?

515
00:34:14.207 --> 00:34:16.606
Like, aliens?

516
00:34:16.608 --> 00:34:17.974
E.T. phone home.

517
00:34:17.976 --> 00:34:19.710
Aliens, yeah.

518
00:34:19.712 --> 00:34:22.245
Yes.

519
00:34:22.247 --> 00:34:23.448
But we don't
call them that.

520
00:34:25.283 --> 00:34:27.317
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

521
00:34:27.319 --> 00:34:29.987
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

522
00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:34.458
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

523
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.327
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

524
00:34:37.329 --> 00:34:41.798
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

525
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.299
So they can live in space?

526
00:34:43.301 --> 00:34:44.734
We call them hosts.

527
00:34:44.736 --> 00:34:47.537
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

528
00:34:47.539 --> 00:34:49.639
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

529
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:50.908
He's just feeding them in.

530
00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:52.876
If the match isn't exact...

531
00:34:52.878 --> 00:34:53.979
Elevators patrol check.

532
00:34:57.916 --> 00:34:59.816
Please, just go in.
Don't touch anything.

533
00:34:59.818 --> 00:35:01.353
- I won't. I won't.
- Go, go, go. I'll take care of him.

534
00:35:04.256 --> 00:35:05.655
Dr. Skirth.

535
00:35:05.657 --> 00:35:06.957
I thought you'd all gone home.

536
00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:09.494
Oh, yes. Well, you know
what they say.

537
00:35:10.762 --> 00:35:11.930
Science never sleeps.

538
00:36:19.965 --> 00:36:22.664
- Eddie! It's me. Let me out!
- Maria? Maria?

539
00:36:22.666 --> 00:36:24.433
- Please! Let me out!
- I don't know how to get you...

540
00:36:24.435 --> 00:36:27.603
- Let me out. Out.
- I don't know how.

541
00:36:27.605 --> 00:36:28.704
Oh, my God.

542
00:36:43.054 --> 00:36:45.355
Oh, God! Maria, no! Maria!

543
00:36:45.357 --> 00:36:47.491
Maria! No, Maria, no!

544
00:36:59.004 --> 00:37:00.802
There has been a
security breach in Lab Sector 3.

545
00:37:00.804 --> 00:37:02.137
Oh, no. Maria?

546
00:37:02.139 --> 00:37:04.605
Maria! Oh, shit.

547
00:37:04.607 --> 00:37:08.510
Repeat, this is
a Code Silver security breach.

548
00:37:08.512 --> 00:37:11.982
All security personnel, please
respond to Lab Sector 3.

549
00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:14.983
Freeze!

550
00:37:46.517 --> 00:37:47.584
Got eyes on!

551
00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:03.865
Go!

552
00:38:03.867 --> 00:38:05.069
Go! Go!

553
00:38:16.112 --> 00:38:17.545
Where the hell'd he go?

554
00:38:17.547 --> 00:38:19.047
- I'm not seeing him.
- Fan out.

555
00:38:19.049 --> 00:38:21.515
- Find him.
- Nothing. Nothing yet.

556
00:38:21.517 --> 00:38:23.920
Search Team 4, Search Team 4.

557
00:38:33.495 --> 00:38:35.763
Backtrack
200 feet east.

558
00:38:39.569 --> 00:38:41.102
This is Dora.
Leave a message.

559
00:38:41.104 --> 00:38:43.938
Skirth, yeah, it's me.
I just got back.

560
00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.007
Are you all right?
I haven't heard from you,

561
00:38:46.009 --> 00:38:47.708
so I want to know
if you're all right.

562
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.576
But, yeah, that was
a great call on the lab.

563
00:38:49.578 --> 00:38:51.512
You're absolutely right.

564
00:38:51.514 --> 00:38:52.913
Yeah. Listen.

565
00:38:52.915 --> 00:38:55.249
I got a... I got a guy.

566
00:38:55.251 --> 00:38:57.020
I'm gonna call him and, uh...

567
00:38:58.155 --> 00:39:00.187
Mmm. Oh...

568
00:39:00.189 --> 00:39:02.223
Oh, I got a bunch of
photographs.

569
00:39:02.225 --> 00:39:04.758
He will publish those photographs,
but I need you to come with me.

570
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.796
Uh, could you just call me back?
Call me back.

571
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:13.535
Whoa.

572
00:39:30.953 --> 00:39:32.088
Yeah.

573
00:39:33.523 --> 00:39:34.323
Mmm.

574
00:39:51.606 --> 00:39:53.141
What is wrong with me?

575
00:40:00.015 --> 00:40:01.650
Eddie.

576
00:40:10.993 --> 00:40:13.026
How bad?

577
00:40:13.028 --> 00:40:14.227
It's bad.

578
00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:15.762
How bad?

579
00:40:15.764 --> 00:40:18.201
Well, we assume
the intruder took it.

580
00:40:20.203 --> 00:40:22.104
Took it? Took it?

581
00:40:23.805 --> 00:40:26.006
We don't know what happened.

582
00:40:26.008 --> 00:40:27.974
I want to speak to every man
who was on duty last night.

583
00:40:27.976 --> 00:40:29.109
- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

584
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:30.944
Get it out of my sight.

585
00:40:30.946 --> 00:40:33.079
- Carlton, you need to see this.
- What now?

586
00:40:33.081 --> 00:40:34.948
His blood
pressure's back to normal.

587
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.716
Liver functions, too.

588
00:40:39.154 --> 00:40:41.020
I knew it.

589
00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:43.024
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

590
00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:48.027
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

591
00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:49.397
- Okay?
- Yeah.

592
00:40:51.666 --> 00:40:52.767
Come on.

593
00:40:53.869 --> 00:40:55.602
You're fired.

594
00:40:55.604 --> 00:40:56.971
Find my Symbiote.

595
00:40:57.671 --> 00:40:58.840
Now!

596
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:20.728
Jesus.

597
00:41:42.049 --> 00:41:45.117
Attention,
passengers for Flight 2517

598
00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:47.686
to San Francisco
via Hong Kong.

599
00:41:47.688 --> 00:41:51.890
We will be boarding
at gate 9 in 15 minutes.

600
00:41:51.892 --> 00:41:53.893
Please have your
boarding passes...

601
00:41:53.895 --> 00:41:55.796
Suzy.
Come on, over here.

602
00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:07.139
May I speak to Annie Weying,
please?

603
00:42:07.141 --> 00:42:09.374
Can you tell her
that it's an emergency?

604
00:42:09.376 --> 00:42:10.744
Food.

605
00:42:11.379 --> 00:42:13.379
Who said that?

606
00:42:13.381 --> 00:42:15.781
No, I'm not talking to you.

607
00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:17.418
Can you please tell me
where she is?

608
00:42:18.819 --> 00:42:21.088
Great. Thank you.

609
00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:27.327
Okay...

610
00:42:31.832 --> 00:42:33.832
Yes, Lana for two?

611
00:42:33.834 --> 00:42:35.200
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

612
00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:36.502
- Sir?
- Oh, yes.

613
00:42:36.504 --> 00:42:37.903
Oh, my God, Eddie.
What are you doing here?

614
00:42:37.905 --> 00:42:39.137
- Annie...
- No, no, no...

615
00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:40.771
No, I have to tell you
something.

616
00:42:40.773 --> 00:42:42.874
- No, no, no. Please.
- No, now. I have to.

617
00:42:42.876 --> 00:42:43.809
Work told me you were here. You're
the only person that I trust.

618
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.077
Are you drunk?

619
00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:46.712
Yeah. No, I broke into
the Life Foundation.

620
00:42:46.714 --> 00:42:48.146
- Eddie, you did what?
- Yeah, but I may...

621
00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:49.414
I think I may have been
infected.

622
00:42:49.416 --> 00:42:50.983
He's burning up.
You're really hot.

623
00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:51.883
Eddie, you look like
you're in a bad way.

624
00:42:51.885 --> 00:42:53.320
I am. I am in a bad way.

625
00:42:56.923 --> 00:42:58.092
Eddie, Jesus!

626
00:42:59.093 --> 00:43:00.227
This is dead.

627
00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:02.194
Dead.

628
00:43:02.196 --> 00:43:03.828
Eddie, sit down.

629
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.797
Okay, all right. Okay.

630
00:43:05.799 --> 00:43:07.366
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

631
00:43:07.368 --> 00:43:09.001
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

632
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:10.135
Put it down. Eddie!

633
00:43:10.137 --> 00:43:12.171
Snap out of it!

634
00:43:14.074 --> 00:43:15.207
No.

635
00:43:15.209 --> 00:43:16.975
All right. It's no good.

636
00:43:16.977 --> 00:43:18.410
Bobby,
are you all right?

637
00:43:18.412 --> 00:43:19.777
- Hey!
- Whoa!

638
00:43:19.779 --> 00:43:21.445
Hey, hey, hey.

639
00:43:21.447 --> 00:43:22.449
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

640
00:43:24.151 --> 00:43:26.083
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

641
00:43:26.085 --> 00:43:27.285
Are you hurt?

642
00:43:27.287 --> 00:43:28.520
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

643
00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:30.222
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

644
00:43:30.224 --> 00:43:31.822
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

645
00:43:31.824 --> 00:43:33.258
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

646
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.825
- No.
- Eddie, please.

647
00:43:34.827 --> 00:43:35.926
Oh, my God.

648
00:43:35.928 --> 00:43:38.196
Ah.

649
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.402
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

650
00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:45.806
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

651
00:43:46.507 --> 00:43:48.173
Patient.

652
00:43:48.175 --> 00:43:49.840
Oh, it's much better.

653
00:43:49.842 --> 00:43:51.242
You are insane.

654
00:43:51.244 --> 00:43:52.778
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

655
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.179
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

656
00:43:54.181 --> 00:43:55.347
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

657
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:57.882
And I have proof!

658
00:43:57.884 --> 00:43:59.116
Ugh.

659
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:08.027
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

660
00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:14.367
Eddie.

661
00:44:15.568 --> 00:44:16.968
Eddie?

662
00:44:18.104 --> 00:44:19.440
Eddie, can you hear me?

663
00:44:20.907 --> 00:44:21.974
This is Dan speaking to you.

664
00:44:23.276 --> 00:44:25.943
Hey, Dan.

665
00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:27.412
- Welcome back.
- Where am I?

666
00:44:27.414 --> 00:44:28.879
Uh, you're in the MRI.

667
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:30.448
Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.

668
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:33.217
- Where is Anne?
- Anne is not here right now.

669
00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:34.852
We're gonna run
some tests, okay?

670
00:44:34.854 --> 00:44:36.120
It's gonna be completely
painless.

671
00:44:36.122 --> 00:44:37.955
So, you know,
just try to stay still.

672
00:44:37.957 --> 00:44:39.625
Uh, relax, and, um...

673
00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:41.926
Yeah, here we go.

674
00:44:48.133 --> 00:44:49.467
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

675
00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:51.068
Eddie, you okay?

676
00:44:55.341 --> 00:44:57.073
Shut it down.

677
00:44:57.075 --> 00:45:00.144
Hey, hey, hey.

678
00:45:00.146 --> 00:45:01.345
You're okay. Yeah.

679
00:45:01.347 --> 00:45:03.481
Coming out. You all right?

680
00:45:03.483 --> 00:45:05.081
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

681
00:45:05.083 --> 00:45:06.584
- You okay?
- Yeah.

682
00:45:06.586 --> 00:45:08.519
- All right.
- Just take a deep breath. Okay? You're okay.

683
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:10.521
Yeah.

684
00:45:10.523 --> 00:45:12.322
Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.

685
00:45:12.324 --> 00:45:14.158
I get claustrophobic, too.

686
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.892
Dr. Lewis?

687
00:45:15.894 --> 00:45:18.027
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

688
00:45:18.029 --> 00:45:19.597
Oh, I just saw Morris.

689
00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:22.933
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

690
00:45:22.935 --> 00:45:24.869
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

691
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:26.936
Yeah, my pleasure.

692
00:45:26.938 --> 00:45:28.638
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

693
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.241
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

694
00:45:30.243 --> 00:45:32.309
Sorry. Gemini.

695
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:33.943
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

696
00:45:33.945 --> 00:45:35.378
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

697
00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.946
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

698
00:45:36.948 --> 00:45:38.282
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

699
00:45:38.284 --> 00:45:39.419
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

700
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.420
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

701
00:45:43.422 --> 00:45:44.654
Did you have
the same reactions

702
00:45:44.656 --> 00:45:46.323
regardless
of the temperature...

703
00:45:49.227 --> 00:45:50.929
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

704
00:45:56.134 --> 00:45:58.268
The creature
and the host are one.

705
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.936
Everything was fine.

706
00:45:59.938 --> 00:46:02.540
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

707
00:46:02.542 --> 00:46:05.542
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

708
00:46:05.544 --> 00:46:07.076
But the organism
is unaffected?

709
00:46:07.078 --> 00:46:08.445
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

710
00:46:08.447 --> 00:46:10.648
But once again,
it's killing the host.

711
00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:11.684
It's consuming his organs.

712
00:46:13.018 --> 00:46:14.352
Oh, watch this.

713
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:20.356
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

714
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.260
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

715
00:46:25.262 --> 00:46:27.932
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

716
00:46:29.201 --> 00:46:30.999
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

717
00:46:31.001 --> 00:46:32.136
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

718
00:46:33.304 --> 00:46:35.238
We're gonna need another host.

719
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.273
Such poor design.

720
00:46:37.275 --> 00:46:40.108
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

721
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.378
Sorry to interrupt.

722
00:46:44.149 --> 00:46:45.981
Thought you'd like
some good news.

723
00:46:45.983 --> 00:46:47.686
I'm sorry.

724
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:59.996
Hungry!

725
00:46:59.998 --> 00:47:02.164
Oh, goddamn.

726
00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:04.066
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

727
00:47:04.068 --> 00:47:06.269
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

728
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:07.570
Thank you.

729
00:47:07.572 --> 00:47:09.137
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

730
00:47:09.139 --> 00:47:11.710
Until the cable car stops.

731
00:47:16.648 --> 00:47:18.748
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

732
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.751
Excuse me.

733
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.155
Oh, hey, Anne.

734
00:47:27.157 --> 00:47:30.126
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

735
00:47:30.128 --> 00:47:32.027
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

736
00:47:32.029 --> 00:47:35.130
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

737
00:47:35.132 --> 00:47:37.000
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

738
00:47:37.002 --> 00:47:38.735
but it would
explain the fever.

739
00:47:38.737 --> 00:47:40.335
That would make sense.

740
00:47:40.337 --> 00:47:44.206
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

741
00:47:44.208 --> 00:47:46.108
Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.

742
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.477
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

743
00:47:47.479 --> 00:47:49.111
I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.

744
00:47:49.113 --> 00:47:51.346
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

745
00:47:51.348 --> 00:47:53.248
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

746
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.183
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

747
00:47:55.185 --> 00:47:58.320
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

748
00:47:58.322 --> 00:48:00.355
but super, super fast?

749
00:48:00.357 --> 00:48:02.124
Yes. We just did.

750
00:48:02.126 --> 00:48:03.492
Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like

751
00:48:03.494 --> 00:48:05.360
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

752
00:48:05.362 --> 00:48:07.529
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

753
00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:10.432
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

754
00:48:10.434 --> 00:48:12.401
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

755
00:48:12.403 --> 00:48:13.735
and we are gonna
clear that out.

756
00:48:13.737 --> 00:48:15.304
- Yes.
- Never gonna happen.

757
00:48:15.306 --> 00:48:18.041
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

758
00:48:18.043 --> 00:48:19.708
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- I know.

759
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.244
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

760
00:48:22.246 --> 00:48:23.712
Who are you talking to?

761
00:48:23.714 --> 00:48:25.615
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

762
00:48:25.617 --> 00:48:28.517
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

763
00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:45.267
Yeah?

764
00:48:45.269 --> 00:48:47.069
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

765
00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:48.804
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

766
00:48:48.806 --> 00:48:50.305
Whatever.

767
00:48:53.242 --> 00:48:55.242
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

768
00:48:55.244 --> 00:48:56.446
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

769
00:48:59.683 --> 00:49:02.185
I was troubled by

770
00:49:03.219 --> 00:49:04.820
what we've been doing.

771
00:49:04.822 --> 00:49:06.622
I get it.

772
00:49:06.624 --> 00:49:07.891
I get it.

773
00:49:09.158 --> 00:49:10.592
We've all been troubled.

774
00:49:10.594 --> 00:49:13.162
It's the nature
of what we do.

775
00:49:14.798 --> 00:49:17.868
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

776
00:49:19.569 --> 00:49:20.870
I need that from you.

777
00:49:23.874 --> 00:49:26.407
I can't do that.

778
00:49:26.409 --> 00:49:29.847
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

779
00:49:30.714 --> 00:49:32.148
your friend.

780
00:49:33.483 --> 00:49:35.216
The person who was here.

781
00:49:35.218 --> 00:49:36.519
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

782
00:49:37.521 --> 00:49:39.755
You know that, right?

783
00:49:39.757 --> 00:49:42.256
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

784
00:49:42.258 --> 00:49:44.527
where you can help
to keep them alive.

785
00:49:47.563 --> 00:49:49.198
Hey. Dora.

786
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.671
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

787
00:49:56.907 --> 00:49:58.207
Will you trust me?

788
00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:06.747
Eddie Brock.

789
00:50:06.749 --> 00:50:07.917
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

790
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.262
You were our best.

791
00:50:19.862 --> 00:50:21.595
Open it.

792
00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:26.935
No! No!

793
00:50:26.937 --> 00:50:29.170
No! No! No!

794
00:50:33.776 --> 00:50:35.545
Do not open that door.

795
00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.378
Huh?

796
00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.927
Stay put.

797
00:50:52.929 --> 00:50:54.795
- Hey, Eddie.
- Who the hell is this guy?

798
00:50:54.797 --> 00:50:57.264
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

799
00:50:57.266 --> 00:50:58.933
Whoa.

800
00:50:58.935 --> 00:51:01.702
- What are you doing?
- I'm, uh...

801
00:51:01.704 --> 00:51:03.403
I'm putting my hands up.

802
00:51:03.405 --> 00:51:05.706
You are making us
look bad.

803
00:51:05.708 --> 00:51:08.676
I...
No, I am not.

804
00:51:08.678 --> 00:51:10.211
Yes, you are.

805
00:51:10.213 --> 00:51:11.611
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

806
00:51:11.613 --> 00:51:13.314
- No, I'm not.
- Why would you do that?

807
00:51:13.316 --> 00:51:15.315
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

808
00:51:15.317 --> 00:51:17.517
- Eddie...
- I will take care of this myself.

809
00:51:17.519 --> 00:51:19.419
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

810
00:51:21.225 --> 00:51:22.024
Take him down.

811
00:51:33.401 --> 00:51:34.803
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

812
00:51:43.345 --> 00:51:46.015
- What is that?
- Not "what." Who.

813
00:51:47.716 --> 00:51:48.850
Oh.

814
00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.361
Shit.

815
00:52:21.283 --> 00:52:23.615
Outstanding.

816
00:52:23.617 --> 00:52:25.652
Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.

817
00:52:25.654 --> 00:52:26.753
Why would we do that?

818
00:52:26.755 --> 00:52:29.558
Pile of bodies, pile of heads.

819
00:52:36.798 --> 00:52:38.399
What the shit, man?

820
00:52:44.072 --> 00:52:46.007
No! No, no, no!

821
00:52:52.781 --> 00:52:54.813
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

822
00:52:54.815 --> 00:52:57.318
Apparently, I have a parasite.

823
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.328
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

824
00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:09.763
Connecting you
to the feed now.

825
00:53:14.936 --> 00:53:16.635
He's achieved symbiosis.

826
00:53:16.637 --> 00:53:18.071
Are you seeing this?

827
00:53:18.073 --> 00:53:20.074
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

828
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:23.076
Treece...

829
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:25.080
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

830
00:53:33.554 --> 00:53:34.788
Eddie.

831
00:53:44.464 --> 00:53:46.832
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

832
00:53:46.834 --> 00:53:48.934
It's not real.
You're in my head.

833
00:53:48.936 --> 00:53:50.502
'Cause you're just a parasite.

834
00:53:50.504 --> 00:53:51.538
"Parasite"?

835
00:53:58.746 --> 00:54:00.814
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

836
00:54:04.652 --> 00:54:06.785
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

837
00:54:06.787 --> 00:54:08.586
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

838
00:54:08.588 --> 00:54:10.989
We can discuss this
like two men.

839
00:54:10.991 --> 00:54:12.493
What is that? What is that?

840
00:54:20.935 --> 00:54:23.001
What?

841
00:54:23.003 --> 00:54:25.470
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

842
00:54:25.472 --> 00:54:28.006
Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.

843
00:54:28.008 --> 00:54:29.109
Launch the drones.

844
00:54:58.471 --> 00:55:00.604
Duck.

845
00:55:01.976 --> 00:55:03.607
Whew!

846
00:55:03.609 --> 00:55:05.512
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

847
00:55:11.551 --> 00:55:13.721
Oh!

848
00:55:21.862 --> 00:55:24.463
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

849
00:55:31.071 --> 00:55:32.805
Oh, God, no!

850
00:55:55.028 --> 00:55:56.827
Holy shit!

851
00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:06.103
Treece, do not
let him get away.

852
00:56:06.105 --> 00:56:08.573
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

853
00:56:14.679 --> 00:56:16.815
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

854
00:56:18.117 --> 00:56:19.619
Oh, God! Do something!

855
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.161
What the...

856
00:56:34.834 --> 00:56:37.136
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

857
00:56:41.307 --> 00:56:42.308
No, no, no! No, no!

858
00:56:45.677 --> 00:56:46.678
No! You're out of your mind!

859
00:56:48.747 --> 00:56:51.084
No!

860
00:57:10.936 --> 00:57:12.905
- That is a dead-end!
- Not for us.

861
00:57:14.606 --> 00:57:16.708
Whoa!

862
00:57:22.881 --> 00:57:23.882
Yeah!

863
00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:55.013
Whoa!

864
00:58:01.853 --> 00:58:03.286
I am going to die!

865
00:58:03.288 --> 00:58:04.723
You are not
going to die!

866
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.104
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

867
00:58:28.647 --> 00:58:29.912
I got him.

868
00:58:29.914 --> 00:58:30.979
- Bring him home.
- Copy that.

869
00:58:30.981 --> 00:58:32.918
This is incredible.

870
00:58:39.223 --> 00:58:42.125
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

871
00:58:42.127 --> 00:58:45.163
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

872
00:58:56.975 --> 00:59:00.943
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

873
00:59:00.945 --> 00:59:03.414
So many snacks,
so little time.

874
00:59:14.059 --> 00:59:15.991
SFPD. Don't move!

875
00:59:15.993 --> 00:59:17.161
Get off the car!

876
00:59:33.944 --> 00:59:34.979
My legs.

877
00:59:37.249 --> 00:59:39.114
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

878
00:59:39.116 --> 00:59:41.518
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

879
00:59:56.867 --> 00:59:58.799
What the hell
are you?

880
00:59:58.801 --> 01:00:01.270
I am Venom.

881
01:00:01.272 --> 01:00:04.039
And you are mine.

882
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:06.408
You bit somebody's head off.

883
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:08.477
Fuel in the tank.

884
01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:10.747
Listen carefully, Eddie.

885
01:00:10.749 --> 01:00:12.981
You did not find us.

886
01:00:12.983 --> 01:00:15.783
We found you.

887
01:00:15.785 --> 01:00:17.819
Think of yourself
as my ride.

888
01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:19.087
Where are you going?

889
01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:22.190
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

890
01:00:22.192 --> 01:00:24.158
You remember him.

891
01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.560
How do you even know
about that?

892
01:00:25.562 --> 01:00:28.063
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

893
01:00:28.065 --> 01:00:29.897
- Everything about you.
- How?

894
01:00:29.899 --> 01:00:32.333
I am inside your head.

895
01:00:32.335 --> 01:00:34.903
You are a loser, Eddie.

896
01:00:39.475 --> 01:00:42.244
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

897
01:00:42.246 --> 01:00:43.545
Most likely.

898
01:00:43.547 --> 01:00:45.012
Oh, God.

899
01:00:45.014 --> 01:00:48.015
That is why we are here.

900
01:00:48.017 --> 01:00:51.322
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

901
01:00:52.489 --> 01:00:54.591
That is the deal.

902
01:00:58.095 --> 01:00:59.428
Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

903
01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:01.329
Welcome to San Francisco.

904
01:01:01.331 --> 01:01:03.232
For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...

905
01:01:24.287 --> 01:01:26.053
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

906
01:01:26.055 --> 01:01:27.887
- Where's Eddie?
- Why? What's happening?

907
01:01:27.889 --> 01:01:29.959
I got Eddie's labs back,

908
01:01:31.361 --> 01:01:33.294
and it's worse than I thought.

909
01:01:33.296 --> 01:01:36.464
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

910
01:01:36.466 --> 01:01:38.199
I've never seen
anything like it.

911
01:01:38.201 --> 01:01:40.000
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

912
01:01:40.002 --> 01:01:41.868
- You need to get him here.
- My God.

913
01:01:45.609 --> 01:01:47.443
- Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.
- Shit.

914
01:01:53.983 --> 01:01:57.318
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

915
01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.487
- Where was he?
- I was...

916
01:01:59.489 --> 01:02:03.493
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

917
01:02:04.527 --> 01:02:05.561
The arrogance.

918
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:15.536
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

919
01:02:15.538 --> 01:02:17.905
not until we find
another suitable host.

920
01:02:17.907 --> 01:02:22.308
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

921
01:02:27.016 --> 01:02:29.316
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

922
01:02:29.318 --> 01:02:31.418
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

923
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.485
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

924
01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:34.422
Found another one, Bill.

925
01:02:34.424 --> 01:02:36.323
Get off the streets.
Go home.

926
01:02:36.325 --> 01:02:38.024
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

927
01:02:38.026 --> 01:02:39.060
Bodies?

928
01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.465
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

929
01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:47.434
Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.

930
01:02:47.436 --> 01:02:49.370
That is none of your
goddamn business.

931
01:02:49.372 --> 01:02:51.938
Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.

932
01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.506
We have no secrets.

933
01:02:53.508 --> 01:02:55.141
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

934
01:02:55.143 --> 01:02:56.644
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

935
01:02:56.646 --> 01:03:00.180
Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.

936
01:03:00.182 --> 01:03:01.981
Shit. Yeah?

937
01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:03.949
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

938
01:03:03.951 --> 01:03:05.686
No, no, you can't see me.

939
01:03:05.688 --> 01:03:07.987
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

940
01:03:07.989 --> 01:03:09.556
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

941
01:03:09.558 --> 01:03:12.125
You cannot come
near me right now.

942
01:03:12.127 --> 01:03:13.928
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- No!

943
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.428
- Eddie?
- No, I gotta go up there.

944
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:16.463
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

945
01:03:16.465 --> 01:03:17.964
I got to get up there, man.

946
01:03:17.966 --> 01:03:20.032
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

947
01:03:20.034 --> 01:03:21.402
There's no such thing
as can't.

948
01:03:21.404 --> 01:03:22.572
I'm sorry, man.

949
01:03:23.505 --> 01:03:26.005
Okay, okay... Uh...

950
01:03:26.007 --> 01:03:28.308
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

951
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.244
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

952
01:03:31.246 --> 01:03:33.546
- Let's eat his brains.
- No! You do not touch him!

953
01:03:33.548 --> 01:03:35.548
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

954
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.618
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

955
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.118
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

956
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.653
- "We"?
- Yeah.

957
01:03:40.655 --> 01:03:42.224
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

958
01:03:44.425 --> 01:03:46.261
Yeah.

959
01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:54.569
- Shit.
- You want up?

960
01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.676
Well, why didn't you just say?

961
01:04:11.486 --> 01:04:14.019
Hmm.

962
01:04:14.021 --> 01:04:17.223
- It is peaceful up here.
- I'm not very good with heights.

963
01:04:17.225 --> 01:04:21.427
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

964
01:04:21.429 --> 01:04:23.997
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

965
01:04:23.999 --> 01:04:25.164
What does that mean?

966
01:04:33.441 --> 01:04:35.140
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

967
01:04:46.053 --> 01:04:47.452
I got us.

968
01:04:47.454 --> 01:04:48.557
Whoa.

969
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:57.597
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

970
01:04:57.599 --> 01:04:59.732
You die, I die.

971
01:04:59.734 --> 01:05:02.134
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

972
01:05:02.136 --> 01:05:04.637
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

973
01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:06.539
Why would I do that?

974
01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:09.541
You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.

975
01:05:09.543 --> 01:05:11.710
Plus, I am starting
to like you.

976
01:05:11.712 --> 01:05:13.180
You and I
are not so different.

977
01:05:13.782 --> 01:05:14.849
Thank you.

978
01:05:18.719 --> 01:05:19.753
Okay.

979
01:05:21.723 --> 01:05:23.223
Here's your evidence.

980
01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.361
Jump.

981
01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:32.531
Pussy.

982
01:05:42.643 --> 01:05:43.777
Hands!

983
01:05:45.713 --> 01:05:47.448
On the ground! Now!

984
01:05:51.852 --> 01:05:54.686
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

985
01:05:54.688 --> 01:05:56.755
- Mask!
- Copy!

986
01:05:56.757 --> 01:05:59.256
All right,
have it your own way.

987
01:05:59.258 --> 01:06:01.126
- Mask!
- Copy.

988
01:06:01.128 --> 01:06:02.661
What the hell
is that thing?

989
01:06:08.267 --> 01:06:09.436
What the hell?

990
01:06:10.671 --> 01:06:12.269
Hold your fire!

991
01:06:12.271 --> 01:06:14.405
Flares!

992
01:06:14.407 --> 01:06:15.506
He's there!
He's there!

993
01:06:15.508 --> 01:06:16.710
Reload!

994
01:06:17.811 --> 01:06:19.544
Anybody see him?

995
01:06:30.456 --> 01:06:32.390
Does anyone have eyes on him?

996
01:06:34.128 --> 01:06:36.229
Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.

997
01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:51.575
I don't have
eyes on him.

998
01:06:53.279 --> 01:06:54.347
Where is it?

999
01:07:01.354 --> 01:07:02.453
Flash grenade!

1000
01:07:03.723 --> 01:07:04.856
Throw them!

1001
01:07:04.858 --> 01:07:06.390
Flash grenade!

1002
01:07:17.437 --> 01:07:18.703
He's in the rafters!

1003
01:07:18.705 --> 01:07:19.770
Above!

1004
01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:26.244
There he is!

1005
01:07:30.883 --> 01:07:32.318
Move, move, move!

1006
01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:03.981
No! We do not
eat policemen!

1007
01:08:10.356 --> 01:08:11.856
Annie! Annie, wait!

1008
01:08:11.858 --> 01:08:13.690
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1009
01:08:13.692 --> 01:08:16.360
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1010
01:08:16.362 --> 01:08:18.829
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1011
01:08:18.831 --> 01:08:20.430
- "He"?
- Yes.

1012
01:08:20.432 --> 01:08:22.866
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1013
01:08:22.868 --> 01:08:25.571
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1014
01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.642
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1015
01:08:34.412 --> 01:08:35.413
Right now.

1016
01:08:38.617 --> 01:08:41.417
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1017
01:08:41.419 --> 01:08:42.487
Get in the car, Eddie.

1018
01:08:44.589 --> 01:08:47.659
- In the back.
- I like her. Get in.

1019
01:08:54.733 --> 01:08:56.836
I'm out of control.

1020
01:08:58.503 --> 01:09:00.004
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1021
01:09:00.006 --> 01:09:01.840
- No MRI.
- No. No. No MRI.

1022
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:04.275
What? Why?

1023
01:09:04.277 --> 01:09:06.376
Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.

1024
01:09:07.946 --> 01:09:11.714
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1025
01:09:11.716 --> 01:09:14.517
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1026
01:09:14.519 --> 01:09:17.319
- Not all sounds.
- And fire.

1027
01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:20.358
- Fire. And fire.
- He's talking to you?

1028
01:09:21.961 --> 01:09:23.395
Always.

1029
01:09:24.496 --> 01:09:26.663
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1030
01:09:26.665 --> 01:09:29.365
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1031
01:09:29.367 --> 01:09:31.668
I'm hungry all the time.

1032
01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:35.006
And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?

1033
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:38.007
Get out of my head, man.

1034
01:09:38.009 --> 01:09:40.476
You never apologized.

1035
01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:43.081
You might not live
to get another chance.

1036
01:09:48.954 --> 01:09:50.786
Annie.

1037
01:09:50.788 --> 01:09:54.457
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1038
01:09:54.459 --> 01:10:00.463
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1039
01:10:00.465 --> 01:10:02.067
I am truly, truly sorry.

1040
01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:05.536
And that I love you.

1041
01:10:06.104 --> 01:10:08.738
Oh, Eddie...

1042
01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.841
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1043
01:10:11.843 --> 01:10:14.476
Aw, that's nice.

1044
01:10:17.682 --> 01:10:22.584
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1045
01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:25.788
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1046
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:26.858
Thank you.

1047
01:10:45.476 --> 01:10:46.510
Hello?

1048
01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:59.057
What are you doing here?

1049
01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.761
Are you lost?

1050
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:07.932
I'm not lost.

1051
01:11:15.506 --> 01:11:17.005
Thanks for coming in.

1052
01:11:17.007 --> 01:11:20.509
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1053
01:11:20.511 --> 01:11:23.413
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1054
01:11:23.415 --> 01:11:25.914
Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.

1055
01:11:25.916 --> 01:11:27.448
I don't want you to fix it.

1056
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.784
I can heal you.

1057
01:11:30.988 --> 01:11:32.688
Can you fix it?

1058
01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:34.622
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1059
01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.825
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- "Parasite"?

1060
01:11:36.827 --> 01:11:38.126
It's eating you
from the inside.

1061
01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:39.761
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1062
01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.863
- You're using him up.
- No. She is wrong.

1063
01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:44.900
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1064
01:11:44.902 --> 01:11:47.501
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- No!

1065
01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.104
You're killing him.

1066
01:11:49.106 --> 01:11:50.571
They do not know
what they are talking about.

1067
01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:52.140
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1068
01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:53.675
- Oh, God!
- We have to get out of here.

1069
01:11:55.012 --> 01:11:56.078
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1070
01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.446
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1071
01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:02.786
No! Don't do that!

1072
01:12:17.968 --> 01:12:21.002
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1073
01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:22.503
What is that?

1074
01:12:29.246 --> 01:12:32.214
You were killing me?

1075
01:12:32.216 --> 01:12:35.285
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1076
01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.791
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1077
01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:44.160
We're done.

1078
01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.897
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1079
01:12:48.899 --> 01:12:50.664
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1080
01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:52.668
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1081
01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:57.139
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1082
01:12:57.141 --> 01:13:01.042
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1083
01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.277
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1084
01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:06.248
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1085
01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:09.984
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1086
01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:11.718
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1087
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.854
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1088
01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.124
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1089
01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:19.928
Dan.

1090
01:13:26.768 --> 01:13:28.003
Where is it?

1091
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.932
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1092
01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:25.758
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1093
01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.363
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1094
01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:34.634
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1095
01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.936
Whoo!

1096
01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:42.276
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1097
01:14:51.853 --> 01:14:53.920
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1098
01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:56.956
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1099
01:14:56.958 --> 01:15:00.860
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1100
01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:02.794
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1101
01:15:02.796 --> 01:15:04.265
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1102
01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.032
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1103
01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:09.202
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1104
01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:11.770
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1105
01:15:11.772 --> 01:15:13.206
It can't go on.

1106
01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.742
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1107
01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.743
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1108
01:15:17.745 --> 01:15:19.646
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1109
01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:23.349
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1110
01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:25.151
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1111
01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:29.355
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1112
01:15:29.357 --> 01:15:31.858
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1113
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.362
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1114
01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:38.798
Man and Symbiote combined.

1115
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.367
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1116
01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:44.437
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1117
01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:47.839
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1118
01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:49.141
It's not a lot of fun.

1119
01:15:49.143 --> 01:15:51.743
And then I find out,
all along,

1120
01:15:51.745 --> 01:15:53.146
that they're killing you.

1121
01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.880
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1122
01:15:54.882 --> 01:15:57.417
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1123
01:15:57.419 --> 01:15:59.953
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1124
01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:01.688
Where's Venom?

1125
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:05.257
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1126
01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:15.133
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1127
01:16:15.135 --> 01:16:17.803
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1128
01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:22.040
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1129
01:16:30.284 --> 01:16:35.722
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1130
01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:39.124
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1131
01:16:39.126 --> 01:16:41.329
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1132
01:16:43.364 --> 01:16:45.130
Where we lead.

1133
01:16:45.132 --> 01:16:46.864
Yes, "we."

1134
01:16:46.866 --> 01:16:50.137
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1135
01:16:51.505 --> 01:16:53.073
I can take care of that.

1136
01:16:58.112 --> 01:17:01.113
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1137
01:17:01.115 --> 01:17:02.116
Shut up.

1138
01:17:05.953 --> 01:17:07.786
Not so tough
without your friend.

1139
01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.128
Did your mama not love you?

1140
01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:18.497
God damn it!

1141
01:17:20.367 --> 01:17:23.535
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1142
01:17:23.537 --> 01:17:25.537
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1143
01:17:25.539 --> 01:17:27.305
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1144
01:17:27.307 --> 01:17:28.375
in this world than you and me.

1145
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:31.543
Much bigger than me.

1146
01:17:31.545 --> 01:17:36.050
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1147
01:17:38.419 --> 01:17:40.252
Karma's a bitch.

1148
01:17:40.254 --> 01:17:41.488
I don't believe in karma.

1149
01:17:43.222 --> 01:17:45.225
Oh! Ooh!

1150
01:17:49.929 --> 01:17:50.995
Hi, Eddie.

1151
01:17:50.997 --> 01:17:53.031
Whoa. Whoa...

1152
01:17:53.033 --> 01:17:55.866
Oh...

1153
01:17:55.868 --> 01:17:56.869
Mmm...

1154
01:17:57.904 --> 01:17:59.105
Mmm!

1155
01:18:15.355 --> 01:18:16.523
Oh, no.

1156
01:18:18.124 --> 01:18:20.524
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1157
01:18:20.526 --> 01:18:23.027
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1158
01:18:23.029 --> 01:18:25.863
- The one with Drake is Riot.
- Who's Riot?

1159
01:18:25.865 --> 01:18:28.366
Riot is what you would call
a team leader.

1160
01:18:28.368 --> 01:18:30.434
He has an arsenal of weapons.

1161
01:18:30.436 --> 01:18:32.870
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
- He is unstoppable.

1162
01:18:32.872 --> 01:18:34.438
- Oh, great.
- We have got to go!

1163
01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.140
Go where? Where we going?

1164
01:18:36.142 --> 01:18:37.575
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- No!

1165
01:18:37.577 --> 01:18:39.477
It's going to get ugly.

1166
01:18:39.479 --> 01:18:41.582
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1167
01:18:43.349 --> 01:18:44.917
Not today.

1168
01:18:46.386 --> 01:18:47.987
Oh, that's bullshit!

1169
01:18:50.156 --> 01:18:51.889
This is not a simulation.

1170
01:18:51.891 --> 01:18:54.057
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1171
01:18:54.059 --> 01:18:56.495
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1172
01:18:56.497 --> 01:18:58.229
- You?
- Yes, me.

1173
01:18:58.231 --> 01:18:59.930
How long?

1174
01:18:59.932 --> 01:19:01.632
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1175
01:19:01.634 --> 01:19:05.004
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1176
01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.341
I'm not alone.

1177
01:19:11.978 --> 01:19:15.279
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1178
01:19:15.281 --> 01:19:17.248
It is not safe for her.

1179
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:18.883
If we do not stop Riot,

1180
01:19:18.885 --> 01:19:22.286
he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.

1181
01:19:22.288 --> 01:19:26.657
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1182
01:19:26.659 --> 01:19:28.926
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1183
01:19:28.928 --> 01:19:30.628
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1184
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:32.396
- on a whole planet?
- Yes!

1185
01:19:32.398 --> 01:19:34.598
But it is
different now, Eddie.

1186
01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.168
- I have decided to stay.
- Wow!

1187
01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:40.203
On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.

1188
01:19:40.205 --> 01:19:42.939
- But here, we could be more.
- Excuse me?

1189
01:19:42.941 --> 01:19:44.675
And I'm getting to
like it here.

1190
01:19:44.677 --> 01:19:47.344
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1191
01:19:47.346 --> 01:19:49.979
However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.

1192
01:19:49.981 --> 01:19:53.983
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1193
01:19:53.985 --> 01:19:56.085
- then it's back to "we."
- It is "we."

1194
01:19:56.087 --> 01:19:58.488
Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.

1195
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:00.191
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1196
01:20:00.193 --> 01:20:01.661
What really made you
change your mind?

1197
01:20:05.464 --> 01:20:08.434
You. You did, Eddie.

1198
01:20:10.436 --> 01:20:13.102
Scrub diagnostics.

1199
01:20:13.104 --> 01:20:15.474
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1200
01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:25.248
T-minus
five minutes to launch.

1201
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:27.586
Auto sequence has been
initiated.

1202
01:20:40.298 --> 01:20:41.667
Oh, shit.

1203
01:20:51.243 --> 01:20:54.178
T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.

1204
01:21:01.653 --> 01:21:05.421
Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?

1205
01:21:05.423 --> 01:21:08.123
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1206
01:21:08.125 --> 01:21:10.225
What does that mean?
What are our chances?

1207
01:21:10.227 --> 01:21:13.663
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1208
01:21:13.665 --> 01:21:16.568
Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.

1209
01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:21.673
T-minus four minutes.

1210
01:21:25.376 --> 01:21:28.179
Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.

1211
01:21:31.449 --> 01:21:34.283
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1212
01:21:34.285 --> 01:21:38.421
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1213
01:21:38.423 --> 01:21:39.756
Then die.

1214
01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:52.502
- Holy shit!
- Told you.

1215
01:21:52.504 --> 01:21:54.138
T-minus three minutes.

1216
01:22:06.584 --> 01:22:08.118
You have a strong host.

1217
01:22:10.387 --> 01:22:11.722
But not strong enough.

1218
01:22:50.494 --> 01:22:53.227
T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.

1219
01:22:55.431 --> 01:22:56.567
Eddie.

1220
01:23:01.105 --> 01:23:02.472
Drake, stop!

1221
01:24:08.739 --> 01:24:11.207
Told you I could fight ugly.

1222
01:24:18.347 --> 01:24:20.650
T-minus one minute.

1223
01:24:38.634 --> 01:24:40.334
You're too late.

1224
01:24:40.336 --> 01:24:41.337
This is the next stage...

1225
01:24:43.406 --> 01:24:45.641
You talk too much.

1226
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.219
T-minus 30 seconds.

1227
01:24:57.221 --> 01:24:58.855
You are nothing.

1228
01:25:27.517 --> 01:25:28.818
Ten seconds.

1229
01:25:29.585 --> 01:25:30.720
Nine...

1230
01:25:31.553 --> 01:25:32.621
Eight...

1231
01:25:33.555 --> 01:25:34.556
Seven...

1232
01:25:35.323 --> 01:25:36.324
Six...

1233
01:25:36.859 --> 01:25:37.894
Five...

1234
01:25:38.694 --> 01:25:40.326
Four...

1235
01:25:40.328 --> 01:25:41.861
Three...

1236
01:25:41.863 --> 01:25:43.731
Two...

1237
01:25:43.733 --> 01:25:45.735
One...

1238
01:25:47.536 --> 01:25:48.703
Liftoff.

1239
01:25:56.045 --> 01:25:57.677
Traitor!

1240
01:25:57.679 --> 01:25:59.447
Have a nice life.

1241
01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.108
Goodbye, Eddie.

1242
01:26:28.376 --> 01:26:29.811
Venom, no!

1243
01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:21.828
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1244
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.428
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1245
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:25.397
I feel great. Awesome.

1246
01:27:25.399 --> 01:27:27.400
Wow.

1247
01:27:27.402 --> 01:27:29.068
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1248
01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:32.571
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1249
01:27:32.573 --> 01:27:34.573
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1250
01:27:34.575 --> 01:27:36.541
You're a good person, Annie.

1251
01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:38.044
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1252
01:27:38.046 --> 01:27:39.878
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1253
01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.914
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1254
01:27:41.916 --> 01:27:44.017
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1255
01:27:44.019 --> 01:27:48.453
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1256
01:27:48.455 --> 01:27:50.555
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1257
01:27:50.557 --> 01:27:52.892
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1258
01:27:52.894 --> 01:27:55.527
Oh! Like everyone else.

1259
01:27:55.529 --> 01:27:56.530
Yeah.

1260
01:27:58.966 --> 01:28:01.202
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1261
01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:04.104
Hey, um...

1262
01:28:06.774 --> 01:28:08.607
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1263
01:28:08.609 --> 01:28:11.812
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1264
01:28:13.446 --> 01:28:17.183
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1265
01:28:17.185 --> 01:28:19.586
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1266
01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:24.458
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1267
01:28:25.092 --> 01:28:26.525
I mean, the...

1268
01:28:26.527 --> 01:28:30.062
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1269
01:28:30.064 --> 01:28:31.630
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1270
01:28:31.632 --> 01:28:32.733
Okay.

1271
01:28:34.034 --> 01:28:35.634
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1272
01:28:35.636 --> 01:28:37.869
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1273
01:28:37.871 --> 01:28:41.606
Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.

1274
01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:44.542
No, I don't think so.

1275
01:28:44.544 --> 01:28:47.011
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1276
01:28:47.013 --> 01:28:48.814
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1277
01:28:48.816 --> 01:28:51.450
- Nope.
- You belong with us, Annie.

1278
01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:52.985
Eddie, are you sure?

1279
01:28:52.987 --> 01:28:54.986
Good Lord, look at that.

1280
01:28:54.988 --> 01:28:57.124
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1281
01:28:58.892 --> 01:29:01.059
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1282
01:29:01.061 --> 01:29:03.463
You take care, all right?

1283
01:29:03.465 --> 01:29:05.265
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1284
01:29:09.203 --> 01:29:12.637
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1285
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:13.807
Either of you.

1286
01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:15.906
We won't.

1287
01:29:15.908 --> 01:29:17.608
- Who is that guy?
- Okay.

1288
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:20.178
Wait.
This thing looks delicious.

1289
01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:22.847
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1290
01:29:22.849 --> 01:29:25.783
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1291
01:29:25.785 --> 01:29:29.553
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1292
01:29:29.555 --> 01:29:31.522
- I cannot?
- No, you cannot.

1293
01:29:31.524 --> 01:29:33.224
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1294
01:29:33.226 --> 01:29:36.795
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1295
01:29:36.797 --> 01:29:39.097
And then there are bad people.

1296
01:29:39.099 --> 01:29:40.965
You have to tell
the difference.

1297
01:29:40.967 --> 01:29:44.835
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1298
01:29:44.837 --> 01:29:48.205
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1299
01:29:48.207 --> 01:29:50.640
eat very, very bad people,

1300
01:29:50.642 --> 01:29:53.544
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1301
01:29:53.546 --> 01:29:55.913
- Fine.
- Good.

1302
01:29:55.915 --> 01:29:57.681
But how does one
tell the difference?

1303
01:29:57.683 --> 01:29:59.784
Well, it's super simple.

1304
01:29:59.786 --> 01:30:02.686
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1305
01:30:02.688 --> 01:30:04.755
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1306
01:30:04.757 --> 01:30:06.190
Whatever you say.

1307
01:30:06.192 --> 01:30:08.260
But can we get something to
eat now?

1308
01:30:08.262 --> 01:30:13.696
Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.

1309
01:30:13.698 --> 01:30:16.002
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1310
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:19.872
Hey, Mrs. C.

1311
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.639
How you doing, Eddie?

1312
01:30:22.641 --> 01:30:24.209
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1313
01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:27.178
No.

1314
01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:30.548
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1315
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:32.216
Tater tots
and chocolate.

1316
01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:33.884
Right. Okay, no problem.

1317
01:30:35.154 --> 01:30:36.721
The payment's due, Chen.

1318
01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:40.224
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1319
01:30:40.226 --> 01:30:41.792
Now.

1320
01:30:41.794 --> 01:30:43.362
- Bad guy, right?
- Yep.

1321
01:30:50.903 --> 01:30:52.969
You come in here again...

1322
01:30:52.971 --> 01:30:57.640
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1323
01:30:57.642 --> 01:31:01.144
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1324
01:31:01.146 --> 01:31:03.147
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1325
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:06.217
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1326
01:31:06.219 --> 01:31:08.119
- Please...
- Yes.

1327
01:31:08.121 --> 01:31:12.022
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1328
01:31:12.024 --> 01:31:16.793
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1329
01:31:16.795 --> 01:31:19.165
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1330
01:31:21.067 --> 01:31:23.635
We are Venom.

1331
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:27.240
- On second thought...
- Please.

1332
01:31:34.312 --> 01:31:36.713
Eddie? What was that?

1333
01:31:36.715 --> 01:31:38.114
Oh...

1334
01:31:38.116 --> 01:31:41.920
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1335
01:31:43.256 --> 01:31:44.787
- "Parasite"?
- Yeah.

1336
01:31:44.789 --> 01:31:46.789
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1337
01:31:46.791 --> 01:31:48.791
- Apologize!
- No.

1338
01:31:48.793 --> 01:31:51.728
- Apologize!
- All right, fine.

1339
01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:54.664
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1340
01:31:54.666 --> 01:31:58.800
The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.

1341
01:34:26.083 --> 01:34:28.015
I need you
to stay quiet.

1342
01:34:28.017 --> 01:34:30.986
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1343
01:34:30.988 --> 01:34:34.124
- You got that?
- Fine, but make it quick.

1344
01:34:38.462 --> 01:34:40.028
Open on five.

1345
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:43.165
Go. Opening up.

1346
01:34:45.234 --> 01:34:47.936
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1347
01:34:47.938 --> 01:34:50.472
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1348
01:34:50.474 --> 01:34:52.206
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1349
01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:54.375
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1350
01:34:54.377 --> 01:34:57.012
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1351
01:34:57.014 --> 01:35:00.147
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1352
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:03.819
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1353
01:35:03.821 --> 01:35:07.290
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1354
01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.263
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1355
01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:36.050
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1356
01:35:36.052 --> 01:35:40.488
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1357
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:41.888
Sure, it's good with me.

1358
01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:44.225
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1359
01:35:44.227 --> 01:35:51.098
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1360
01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:53.167
I bet you can.

1361
01:35:53.169 --> 01:35:55.638
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1362
01:35:56.472 --> 01:35:57.507
Come on over.

1363
01:35:58.474 --> 01:35:59.942
All right.

1364
01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.279
I'm here.

1365
01:36:06.281 --> 01:36:10.017
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1366
01:36:11.354 --> 01:36:13.322
there's gonna be carnage.

1367
01:48:24.955 --> 01:48:27.123
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1368
01:48:27.766 --> 01:48:29.833
I want to do what you asked.

1369
01:48:29.835 --> 01:48:31.469
I really do.

1370
01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.770
But... I'm sorry.

1371
01:48:38.043 --> 01:48:40.444
I can't do this without you.

1372
01:48:41.914 --> 01:48:42.980
Hey, kid...

1373
01:48:42.982 --> 01:48:44.281
Whoa.

1374
01:48:44.283 --> 01:48:45.284
What was... Whoa!

1375
01:48:49.154 --> 01:48:50.155
What?

1376
01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:53.226
Huh?

1377
01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:02.836
No.

1378
01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:09.041
Who are you?

1379
01:49:09.043 --> 01:49:10.403
What are you
doing over there?

1380
01:49:11.279 --> 01:49:13.211
Freeze! PDNY.

1381
01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:15.213
Kid, freeze!

1382
01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:19.986
You're kidding me right now?

1383
01:49:22.056 --> 01:49:23.457
Hey, kid.
Drop the body.

1384
01:49:32.467 --> 01:49:33.866
Ow!

1385
01:49:33.868 --> 01:49:35.069
Somebody stop that train!

1386
01:49:47.516 --> 01:49:48.584
Aah!

1387
01:49:57.527 --> 01:49:59.025
Sorry.

1388
01:50:08.136 --> 01:50:10.504
...looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man,

1389
01:50:10.506 --> 01:50:12.038
dragging a homeless corpse

1390
01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.340
behind a train.

1391
01:50:13.342 --> 01:50:14.788
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1392
01:50:14.812 --> 01:50:16.143
Why are you
trying to kill me?

1393
01:50:16.145 --> 01:50:17.545
I'm not.
I'm trying to save you.

1394
01:50:37.166 --> 01:50:40.368
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

1395
01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:42.905
All right.
Thanks, New York.
